# üéß Exploring the Relationship Between Music Streaming Habits and Anxiety Levels

üìä *A Data Science Project by Muh. Yusuf Fikry*

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between music streaming habits and self-reported anxiety levels using a survey-based dataset. With the help of AI-assisted tools, we aim to find patterns in how streaming platforms, listening habits, and musical engagement may relate to mental health, particularly anxiety.

## üßæ Dataset

- **Name:** Music & Mental Health Survey Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Entries:** 736  
- **Features:** 33  

###  Key Columns:
- `Anxiety`
- `Primary streaming service`
- `Hours per day`
- `Music effects`
- `Plays instrument`

---

##  Objectives

- Does the use of certain streaming platforms correlate with higher anxiety levels?
- Do people who play musical instruments have different anxiety levels?
- How long do people typically listen to music per day, and how does that relate to anxiety?

## ‚öô Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning & Inspection**
2. **Descriptive Statistics**
3. **Natural Language Querying via AI Agent**
4. **Visualization** using Matplotlib (Bar & Pie charts)

---

##  Key Findings

- **Average listening time**: 3.57 hours/day  
- **Overall average anxiety**: 5.85 (scale 1‚Äì10)  
- **Apple Music** users showed the **highest average anxiety** (~6.7)  
- **Spotify** came second (~6.0), while those not using streaming services reported **lower anxiety** (~5.4)  
- Playing a musical instrument did **not necessarily correlate** with lower anxiety

##  Conclusion & Recommendations

- There may be a correlation between preferred streaming platform and anxiety levels.
- Apple Music users showed the highest average anxiety.
- No significant evidence that playing an instrument reduces anxiety.
- Further regression analysis and causal modeling are recommended.
- Consider promoting digital hygiene awareness for music streamers.
